# Word-by-Word Translator

This project is a web-based translation application that not only translates text but also provides a word-for-word breakdown, enhancing language learning and comprehension. It utilizes Flask for the web framework and the `deep_translator` library for translation.

## Description

A translation application that provides a word-for-word breakdown of translated text. It utilizes Python for translation processing, while Flask serves as the web framework. The application offers a clean and responsive layout, designed with Bootstrap. Key features include source and target language selection, instant translation results, and a segmented display showing each source word alongside its corresponding translation, enhancing language learning and comprehension.

## Features

* **Wide Language Support:** Supports a vast array of languages (see the `languages` dictionary in `app.py`).
* **Word-by-Word Translation:** Displays each source word and its corresponding translation.
* **Flask Web Framework:** Provides a robust and scalable web interface.
* **Bootstrap Integration:** Offers a responsive and aesthetically pleasing design.
* **Easy Language Selection:** Simple dropdown menus for source and target language selection.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.x
* pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

    Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your repository and `<repository_directory>` with the folder the repository was cloned into.

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

    * For Windows:

        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    * For macOS and Linux:

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install Flask deep-translator
    ```

## Running the Application

1.  **Run the Flask application:**

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2.  **Open your web browser:**

    Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the application.

## Usage

1.  **Enter Text:** Type or paste the text you want to translate into the input field.
2.  **Select Languages:** Choose the source and target languages from the dropdown menus.
3.  **Translate:** The translated text and word-by-word breakdown will be displayed below.

## Dependencies

* Flask: A web framework for Python.
* deep-translator: A library for translating text using various translation APIs.
* Bootstrap: Used for front-end styling.
